#Study Sites, a Neighborhood Map Project

This is single page application that makes calls to location based service APIs (Google Maps and foursquares) to retrive data and then displays it using text, images and markers on a Google Map. 

The app is built using JavaScript and Knockout JS. It employs a responsive design through CSS media queries based on different screen sizes.

##APP SETUP

No set up is needed. Just open index.html and the app will render itself.

##Code Layout

All html is inside index.html
All styling code is in /css/style.css
ALL JavaScript code is in /js/script.js
